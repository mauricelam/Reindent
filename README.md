Reindent (Sublime Text 2 plugin)
==========

Reindent is a collection of functionalities related to reindentation. 
1. Paste and Reindent (Cmd + Shift + V / Ctrl + Shift + V) reindents the pasted text, which indents line pasting as well as multiline pasting. 
2. Move up / down and Reindent (Cmd + Ctrl + up / Ctrl + Shift + up) swaps the current line up or down, and then reindents them. Works perfectly in most languages, but a bit flaky in Python due to reindentation.
